# Compound Interest Calculator

### Description
This is my Compound Interest Calculator. Using CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and JSON I made this happen. I found the equation online and inputted it into my program so it works correctly. The CSS is all the designing parts, personally my favorite one. The javascript is where I did the math, input boxes, etc. The HTML was the base of the whole thing, I put my text in there and setup each piece of my program. This project was created in CodeSandbox
